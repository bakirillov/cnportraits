# cnportraits
## Implementation of Complex Network portraits algorithm    
      
Original algorithm was introduced by Bagrow, Bollt, Scufca and ben-Abraham in https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703470v2

usage: cnportraits.py [-h] Graph Portrait Mode    
    
positional arguments:   
  Graph       Input file    
  Portrait    Output picture or matrix    
  Mode        Output mode    
    
optional arguments:    
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit     

## To do:
1. Distance computation as described in the paper;   
2. Animation of portrait changes given changes in the network structure;
